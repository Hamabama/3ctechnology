After hardening of the material in 3-7 days the «3С» layer is covered with a 1-2 mm
layer of single component rubber (bitumen cold wax). On top of it is laid glass
fibre cloth and another 2-3 mm layer of bitumen wax. On the very top the roof is
protected with any known technique. The procedure is simple and replaces the
traditional multi-layer "pie" of flammable roll materials.

<p>«3С» concrete prepared from the «3С» dry mix is especially
advantageous when used for construction of roads on
soft soils! There is no need to remove soft soil until
firm ground is reached and to replace it with rocky soil;
thus, the <strong>construction costs can be considerably decreased</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>High-performance and high-volume preparation of «3С» concrete compare to foam concrete, which substantially decreases time of works.</strong></p>

<p>«3С» concrete is a light-weight material <strong>(300 - 400 kg/m&#179;)</strong>,
which is <strong>monolithic</strong> and <strong>strong</strong>.
Concrete is placed directly upon soft soil, creating a pontoon effect and serves as a base for the subsequent pavement layers.
The technology is far less costly (more than twice) in comparison with the existing road building methods!
The road boasts high stability in earthquake areas and is characterized by good insulation properties
(capillary water interception, absence of frost heaving, reduced risk of soil freezing).</p>
<p>
<strong>The advantages of using «3С» for road construction are:</strong>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Capillary blocking</strong> - using «3С» within the roadway and the sidewalk reduces significantly the damage from frost heaving during the spring thaw.
  The use of «3С» as a base for the sidewalk and the road creates an extremely rigid foundation, thus prolonging the life of the pavement and reducing maintenance costs;</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Lower costs</strong> - «3С» replaces the insulation and bulk materials in construction and requires a much smaller thickness because of its characteristics, so as a result significant financial savings are realized;</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Easy to use</strong> - «3С» has a liquid consistency, so it is not afraid of the roughness of the excavation. Monolithic porous concrete can be cast and aligned exactly to the required level (thickness);</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Less excavation</strong> - «3С» typically requires three to four times less thickness than the loose materials (sand, gravel), and therefore reduces equally the depth of the excavation;</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Protection</strong> from adverse weather conditions - the use of «3С» protects the soil (the sub-grade) from softening in precipitation;</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Reduction</strong> of external damage - dumping and compacting of loose materials may violate and weaken the base of the soil sub-grade.</span></li>

                        construction, it leaves all other alternatives far behind when used as tunnel backfill! «3С» concrete,
                        in contrast to soil, is a
                        <strong>light-weight (300-400 kg/m&#179;)
monolithic material</strong>; it is characterized by quite a <strong>high strength</strong> and <strong>low thermal conductivity</strong>.
                        All the above characteristics prevent soil from sinking, substantially reduce the pressure on the
                        tunnel structure and minimize the depth of frost penetration. In deep-bore construction, it is used
                        for filling the voids developed during the construction of the tunnel.</p>

                    <p>Our Company has developed a unique technology for making wall panels from «3С» concrete. This technology
                        makes it possible to <strong>reduce
substantially the time required for low-rise construction</strong>. A crew of 3 people and a boom truck can build a 200 square
                        meters shell from «3С» wall panels within 1 week. </p>
                    <p>As an example, the <strong>weight of one wall panel SP12 – 1200 х 3100 х 380 mm,
Type 400 – is 650 kg</strong>. In terms of thermal conductivity, it matches the characteristics of a wire-cut brick wall
                        having the thickness of 3.5 m. The building needs only finishing,
                        <strong>without any additional inside or outside heat insulation!</strong></p>
                    <p>«3С» wall panels (L-shaped, partition, windowed panels, etc.) are designed with consideration for grooves
                        along the perimeter of the panel for further installation of reinforcement and covering the interior
                        space of the grooves with «3С» concrete prepared from the «3С» dry mix right at the construction
                        site. The resulting grouting of panel joints <strong>eliminates any risk of
occurrence of thermal bridges, which are typically observed in standard construction.</strong> </p>
