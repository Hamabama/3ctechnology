                        <p><b>1. What is the difference between foam concrete and autoclaved aerated concrete?</b></p>
                        <p>
                            Both foam concrete and autoclaved aerated concrete belong to the family of cellular concretes; only the methods of pore formation
                            are different. Autoclaved aerated concrete is the lightweight artificial stone; during its preparation
                            process the added chemicals enter into reaction with the cement mixture, which, as a result,
                            generates gas. Foam concrete is prepared in two ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>
                                A foaming agent is added to the liquid, finely dispersed cement mixture; when stirred and shaken vigorously, the concrete mixture develops a lot of stable air bubbles;
                            </span></li>
                            <li><span>Ready-to-use foam is mixed into the prepared concrete mixture.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><b>2. What is the difference between the autoclave and non-autoclave methods of manufacturing cellular concrete?</b></p>
                        <p>The autoclave method requires a pressure vessel where concrete is cured at high temperatures to accelerate
                            the reaction and to increase the product yield.</p>
                        <p>
                            With the non-autoclave method (hydration and hardening), concrete hardens in natural conditions when electrically heated
                            or cured with saturated steam at atmospheric pressure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            No, it does not. The «3С» dry mix for «3С» concrete is easy to use: Mix it with water, pour where you need it and give it
                            time to form cellular texture. You can use any mixing equipment, even a hand drill.
                        </p>

                                On average, it takes 21-27 days to build a two-story cottage, completely finished and ready to move in. The cost depends
                                on the availability and prices for «3С» dry mix in the region. Call us to check the costs

                            <p>
                                The water and «3С» dry mix ratio varies depending on the required density and specification of the project.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>11. What are requirements for the water quality for «3С» concrete?</b></p>
                            <p>Drinking water can be used without any limitations; service waiter can be used only after it
                                has been checked.</p>

                            <p><b>12. What water temperature is required?</b></p>
                            <p>Cool running water.</p>

                                These two parameters are interdependent. The lower the density is, the lower the strength will be, though the heat resistance
                                will increase. «3С» concrete plants can be used for making mixtures ranging from 250 kg/m&#179;
                                to 1,600 kg/m&#179;. For example, the cellular concrete with bulk density of 600 kg/m&#179;
                                has strength at least 25 kg/cm&#178;.

                            <p>As the material is characterized by excellent adhesion, there are no limitations. Furthermore,
                                the long experience of operation (more than 50 years) proves that the reinforcement steel
                                did not corrode in cellular concrete.</p>

                                differ significantly in their chemical and physical properties. Constituents include, first
                                of all, reinforcing elements responsible for mechanical characteristics of the material as
                                well as a matrix (or a binder) responsible for the joint work of the reinforcing elements.
                                The combination of constituents results in a new material having unique properties unavailable
                                to the constituent materials, if they are used separately.

                                The first patent dates back to 1889; it was issued to a Czech engineer - Hoffman. He received aerated concrete by using the
                                gas resulting from the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium bicarbonate. Although
                                the invention did not find a wide application, it was used for production of gas gypsum patented
                                in Germany. Years passed by, and it was only in 1917 when the next patent was issued in Holland
                                for gas formation with the help of organic compounds (yeast). In 1919, the German inventor
                                Grosch was the first to use metal powder for gas formation. The method has been extensively
                                used till the present time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first Swedish patent belongs to Erickson (Stockholm, 1923) who is often referred to as the founder of aerated concrete,
                                which, thanks to him, found its wide application. Although the number of patents has increased
                                considerably, most of them offer upgraded solutions to the existing technology. It should
                                be mentioned that only few of them proved their viability and profitability. Foamed concrete
                                owes its existence to organic chemistry. These types of concrete are produced by adding foaming
                                agents into a base mix of cement paste or mortar; foaming agents are generally products of
                                organic origin. The first patent dates back to 1925 and belongs to the Danish engineer Bayer.
                                Since then different foaming agents have been used with varying success. Foamed concrete
                                boasts a larger number of patents than aerated concrete.

                                of cellular concrete. However, most inventors did not have enough money to continue their
                                research and to improve the production process. The tests conducted in laboratories of large
                                manufacturing companies and research centers (at first, in Sweden, then in Germany) made
                                it possible to develop the technology to be further used in production.

                                It is also important to note that experimental procedures, which may involve ignorance and unscrupulousness of the researchers,
                                often lead to non-reproducibility of the research results and even to their manipulation.
